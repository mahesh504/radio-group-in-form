Radiogroup validation in form flutter

## Getting Started
Hi Folks, in this project i have added solution radio group validation in form

we are unable prompt user to select radio option directly, to propt user i have combined radio and textformfiled in column widget,
radio selected data will be updated in textform filed vise versa,

we can display form validation text inside form field using form validation


used following data for display data
 List<Map> data = [
    {
      "key": "a",
      "val": "one",
    },
    {"key": "b", "val": "two"},
    {"key": "c", "val": "three"},
    {"key": "d", "val": "four"}
  ];
